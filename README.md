# Plants Vs Zombies
Own version of Plants Vs Zombies game made from scratch that combines functional and object-oriented programming paradigms and includes A.I. powered enemies. Instead of Plants and Zombies I decided to use Ants and Bees.

As the ant queen, you populate your colony with the bravest ants you can muster. Your ants must protect their queen from the evil bees that invade your territory. Irritate the bees enough by throwing leaves at them, and they will be vanquished. Fail to pester the airborne intruders adequately, and your queen will succumb to the bees' wrath. This game is inspired by PopCap Games' Plants Vs. Zombies:

## How To Play

Once all of the files are acquired, go to your terminal and go to the corresponding directory. In order to launch the game, you must enter the following command:

python3 ants_gui.py -d DIFFICULTY -w 

Replace DIFFICULTY with one of the following in order to set the difficulty of the game: easy, normal, hard, or insane.
Having -w loads a full layout that includes water spaces, if you do not want any water spaces eliminate -w from the command.
