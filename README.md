# Plants Vs Zombies
Own version of Plants Vs Zombies game made from scratch that combines functional and object-oriented programming paradigms and includes A.I. powered enemies. Instead of Plants and Zombies I decided to use Ants and Bees.

As the ant queen, you populate your colony with the bravest ants you can muster. Your ants must protect their queen from the evil bees that invade your territory. Irritate the bees enough by throwing leaves at them, and they will be vanquished. Fail to pester the airborne intruders adequately, and your queen will succumb to the bees' wrath. This game is inspired by PopCap Games' Plants Vs. Zombies.
